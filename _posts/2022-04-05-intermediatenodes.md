## Introduction
---

Unreal Engines Blueprint Graph uses something known as Kismet 2 Nodes or K2 Nodes for short.

They are the normal blueprint nodes that we all know and love from the engine but for the sake of this blog post I'll be referring to them as "K2 Nodes".

To explain to you why these nodes sometimes "lie" to you I'll have to explain some different types of K2 Nodes in Unreal.
They're both technically just K2Nodes and there are many different ways to make them but I'll be covering the two most common types you'll be running into when making them or in plugins and referring to them as "Intermediate nodes" and "Function nodes" in this blog post.

I won't be going too into depth so anyone can follow along.

I'll also cover how you can visualize your compiled blueprint graphs in-engine to help with debugging either your blueprints or your custom K2Nodes at the end of this post.

## Function nodes
---

Usually when I hear people explain what "Blueprint Nodes" are, it goes along the lines of 
>they're just blocks of c++ code in a visual format

and well, that is true, they are but it gets a bit more complicated than that.

One of the most common type of blueprint nodes you'll be working with are of the class `K2Node_CallFunction` which does what the name suggests, it calls a c++ function. 
This is basically how any of your `UFUNCTION` macros work when exposing functions to Blueprints if you've ever exposed c++ logic to the engine before. This is pretty straight forward and makes sense with the aforementioned statement however not all nodes work like this.

## Intermediate nodes
---

Let's get into intermediate nodes and what they are. For this we'll use the Format Text node as an example shown here:

Now this looks pretty standard, this is what you would see on your end when writing blueprint logic but what you see isn't always the truth.
Below you'll see an image of the compiled blueprint graph for the same image above, this looks a bit different. It is creating a new struct per input and feeding its values into the struct, turning the structs into an array and feeding that array into the function that converts it all to FText.

Let's start by explaining what is going on here...

The K2Node when compiled is executing logic that spawns "Intermediate" nodes, these are basically temporary nodes that are replacing your existing blueprint node with new ones that execute the actual logic when the blueprint is compiled.

This is the most common type of K2Node you'll find in plugins or make for yourself, these work pretty much exactly like a Blueprint Macro [(like explained here)](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/ProgrammingAndScripting/Blueprints/BestPractices/)

> Macros take the nodes from the macro graph, and actually replace the macro node with a copy of all those nodes. Basically, when the Blueprint is compiled, the macro copies all the graph nodes, and pastes them in where the macro node is.

This is what a K2Node that spawns Intermediate Nodes does as well, just that instead of creating a macro in engine the coder has to actually code the logic that spawns the nodes, re-routes their pins etc.

If you want to take a closer look at how this `K2Node_FormatText` works you can find it in the source under: `Engine\Source\Editor\BlueprintGraph`.

Here is another example of a ForEachMapLoop node(wip) I am making for my [HGUtilities](https://utils.hideout.no/) plugin:

You can see here that the un-compiled blueprint graph has one node in it but in reality there is actually a lot more going on.

There are more ways to make K2Nodes but these are the most common you'll need to understand when working with or making custom nodes for the engine.

Now, I won't go into depth on how to create K2Nodes in this post but if you're interessted in that check out this well written introduction from [MagForceSeven](https://www.gamedev.net/tutorials/programming/engines-and-middleware/improving-ue4-blueprint-usability-with-custom-nodes-r5694/).

>How does this help me?

Well, with this knowledge you can use it to optimize your blueprints or perhaps troubleshoot your own K2Nodes with this nifty trick I'll cover below and it should give you a pretty good baseline of how the most common type of K2Nodes you'll be making work. Having a basic understanding of what is actually going on with your blueprint logic is also quite useful.

## Visualize the Intermediate Build Product
---

You can show the compiled intermediate build product in your Blueprint Graph by enabling an option under:

 File -> Developer -> Save Intermediate Build Product

Then compile your blueprint graph and you'll see the intermediate graphs under "My Blueprints":

Thanks to [Sebastian Krause](https://twitter.com/HatiEth) for showing me this useful trick.
